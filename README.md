# Sound-Classification

## Short description

### What's the problem?

Sound classification is useful for building smart cities, for identifying sounds of a machinery and detect whether all the parts are working fine. The problem of identifying sounds is related to the frequency distribution, which was plotted here using waveplot graph and MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient). 

These features (MFCC) are extracted and Convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained.
